# Voronoi Diagrams
This folder contains the full code used to produce the Voronoi diagrams featured in our Youtube video. The R script is split by example/application with full commenting.

If you want to learn to draw Voronoi diagrams by hand, check out this brilliant guide and video from other creators:

## Our Diagrams

There are certain factors that may affect the precision of the Voronoi diagrams we created in R:

- The x-y scale at which the plots are prodcued in R may distort the true differences between the pubs
- The latitude and longitude coordinates used in our diagram are subject to a margin from area as a result of the small distance between the pubs and the precise location of the pubs according to Google Maps
